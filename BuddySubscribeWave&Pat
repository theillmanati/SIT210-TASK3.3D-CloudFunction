// ---------------------------------
// Task 3.3D Particle - Buddy system
// ---------------------------------

/*-------------
Every program based on Wiring (programming language used by Arduino, 
and Particle devices) has two essential parts:
setup - runs once at the beginning of your program
loop - runs continuously over and over

This program will see a Particle device (in this case an Argon) subscribe to an event 
being published by another Particle device (in this case a Photon).

This program is for the subscribing by the Particle Argon to an event published by the 
Particle Photon.

// blinks and time of each blink.

// You'll need to wire a blue LED to this pin.
const int WAVE_BLINKS = 3; // The blue led will blink 3 times
const int WAVE_TIME = 1000; // Each blink will last 1000 milliseconds

// You'll need to wire a red LED to this pin.
